```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Prerequisites

You are going to need to install a few extra packages
```{r cars}
# these are packages you will need, but probably already have.
# Don't bother installing if you already have them
install.packages(c("ggplot2", "devtools", "dplyr", "stringr"))

# some standard map packages.
install.packages(c("maps", "mapdata"))

# the github version of ggmap, which recently pulled in a small fix I had
# for a bug 
devtools::install_github("dkahle/ggmap")
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
